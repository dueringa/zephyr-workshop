# Zephyr Workshop

This repository contains slides and firmware examples for a Zephyr workshop.
The workshop targets students and beginners. It lists existing references on
how to get started and explains basic RTOS concepts with examples.

## Slides

The presentation slides are written with Latex Beamer and the
[mtheme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme/tree/master). To build the
presentation and generate a pdf file execute `make`.

## Firmware Samples

There are several samples in the folder `samples`. The samples are mostly taken
from the samples in the [Zephyr GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr). All samples can be
build as an out-of-tree example.
